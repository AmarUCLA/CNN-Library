**ðŸ”¥ Basic ConvNet**

  - Simple Convolutional Network with BatchNorm.

  <summary>ðŸ”¥ AlexNet</summary>
<p>
Before AlexNet, SIFT(scale-invariant feature transform), SURF or HOG were some of the hand tuned feature extractors for Computer Vision.

  In AlexNet, Interestingly in the lowest layers of the network, the model learned feature extractors that resembled some traditional filters.
Higher layers in the network might build upon these representations to represent larger structures, like eyes, noses, blades of grass, and so on.
Even higher layers might represent whole objects like people, airplanes, dogs, or frisbees. Ultimately, the final hidden state learns a compact
representation of the image that summarizes its contents such that data belonging to different categories can be easily separated.
Challenges perceived before AlexNet:

  Computational Power:

  Due to the limited memory in early GPUs, the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design, so that each of their two GPUs could be responsible
for storing and computing only its half of the model. Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now, so we rarely need to break up models
across GPUs these days.

  Data Availability:

  ImageNet was released during this period by researchers under Fei-Fei Li with 1 million images, 1000 images per class with total of 1000 class.

  Note:
    Instead of using ImageNet, I am using MNIST and resizing the image to 224 x 224 dimension to make it justify with the AlexNet architecture.

  <summary>ðŸ”¥ VGGNet</summary>
  
  <p>VGGNet brings in the idea of buliding a block of network like a template unlike previous CNN architecture 
    where the network is built layer by layer with increasing complexity.
  
  VGG network helps researchers think in terms of block of network. A typical network of convolution would 
require following steps
  
* Conv with padding for maintaining resolution.
* Activation Function
* Pooling for spatial downsampling
  
Note: I don't recommend running this until you have GPU, the number of parameters is increased by huge number compared
to AlexNet.
  
Changes made for faster convergence and which deviates from VGG Net is learning rate is changed to 0.05 and reduce the
number channels by 1/4th.
  
Check out the loss with these changes, since lr is high compared to typical values, the loss moves drastically and then
converges. Without Xavier's Weight Initialization, the model performs poorly.

Why VGG is slower than AlexNet?

  One reason is that AlexNet uses (11x11 with a stride of 4), while VGG uses very small receptive fields (3x3 with a
stride of 1) which makes it slower to move over the image and overall the parameters are 3 times the AlexNet.
This architecture is VGG-11.

  <summary>ðŸ”¥ NIN</summary>
  NIN - Network In Network
<p>
  <strong>Network In Network introduced one of the key concept in deep neural network of dimension downsampling/upsampling using 1x1Conv layer.
  It applies MLP on the channels for each pixel separately.</strong>

  The idea behind NiN is to apply a fully-connected layer at each pixel location (for each height and width). 
If we tie the weights across each spatial location, we could think of this as a 1Ã—1 convolutional layer 
or as a fully-connected layer acting independently on each pixel location. Another way to view this is to think
of each element in the spatial dimension (height and width) as equivalent to an example and a channel as equivalent
to a feature.

  NIN introduces the 1x1 Convolution. Smaller batch size results in better performance even though it is slow.

<summary>ðŸ”¥ GoogLeNet</summary>
<p>
It combined ideas from NIN and VGG network introducing InceptionV1 also known as GoogLeNet. 

  In AlexNet, we've used 11x11 Conv, in NIN, we used 1x1 Conv. And in this paper, we identify
among different kernel, which sized convolutional kernels are best. It is the version 1 of Inception
model. 

GoogLeNet introduces the concept of parallel concatenation of networks. We bulid Inception block and 
which is repeated in the architecture.

Some intution on the architecture, since the various different sized filters are at work, different spatial
relations are extracted by different filters efficiently. It also allocates different amt of parameters
across different filters.

* 1Ã—1 convolutions reduce channel dimensionality on a per-pixel level. Maximum pooling reduces the resolution.
* If you're wondering how these dimensions were decided, it is based on trial and error & based on ImageNet 
Dataset.

**ðŸ”¥ BatchNorm + ConvNet**

  ![BatchNorm Block](Images/batchnorm.png)

  - BatchNorm was introduced as a concept to **normalize the mini-batches traversing through the layer** and had an impactful results having **regularization** effect. But why BatchNorm is effective is quite unclear? the author suggests that BatchNorm reduce internal variant shift but other researchers  pointed out that the effects which batchNorm is effective against is not related to covariant shift. It is still widely discussed topic in DL.

<summary>ðŸ”¥ ResNet</summary>
<p>
  ResNet Architecture has huge influence in current DNN architectures. It introduces the idea of **skip connection**, a concept of **adding** an unfiltered input to the conv layers.
  
Why ResNet?

To understand the network as we add more layers, does it becomes more expressive of the
task in hand or otherwise.

Key idea of ResNet is adding more layers which acts as a Identity function, i.e. if our
underlying mapping function which the network is trying to learn is F(x) = x, then instead
of trying to learn F(x) with Conv layers between them, we can directly add an skip connection
to tend the weight and biases of F(x) to zero. This is part of the explanation from D2L.
Adding new layer led to ResNet Block in the ResNet Architecture.

In ResNet block, in addition to typical Conv layers the authors introduce a parallel identity 
mapping skipping the conv layers to directly connect the input with output of conv layers.
A such connection is termed as Skip Connection or Residual connection.

Things to note while adding the skip connection to output conv block is the dimensions.Important
to note, as mentioned earlier in NIN network, we can use 1x1 Conv to increase and decrease the 
dimension.

In the code block, we have built ResNet18 architecture:

There are 4 convolutional layers in each module (excluding the 1Ã—1 convolutional layer). 
Together with the first 7Ã—7 convolutional layer and the final fully-connected layer, there are 
18 layers in total. Therefore, this model is commonly known as ResNet-18.

<summary>ðŸ”¥ DenseNet</summary>
  <p>
Building upon ResNet, DenseNet introduced the idea of **concatenating** the previous layers 
output and as well the inputs to the next layers.
    
In ResNet, we see how the skip connection added as identity function from the inputs
to interact with the Conv layers. But in DenseNet, we see instead of adding skip 
connection to Conv layers, we can append or concat the output of identity function
with output of Conv layers.

In ResNet, it is little tedious to make the dimensions to match for adding the skip
connection and Conv Layers, but it is much simpler in DenseNet, as we concat the 
both the X and Conv's output.

The key idea or the reason its called DenseNet is because the next layers not only get
the input from previous layer but also preceeding layers before the previous layer. So 
the next layer becomes dense as it loaded with output from previous layers.

Check Figure 7.7.2 from https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/densenet.html for 
why DenseNet is Dense?

Two blocks comprise DenseNet, one is DenseBlock for concat operation and other is 
transition layer for controlling channels meaning dimensions (recall 1x1 Conv).

<summary>ðŸ”¥ Squeeze And Excitation Network</summary>
<p>
A typical convolution network has kernels running through image channels and combining
the feature maps generated per channel. For each channel, we'll have separate kernel which
learns the weights through backpropagation.
  
The idea is to understand the interdependencies between channels of the images by explicitly
modeling on it and hence to make the network sensitive to informative features which is further
exploited in the next set of transformation.

  * Squeeze(Global Information Embedding) operation converts feature maps into single value per channel.
  * Excitation(Adaptive Recalibration) operation converts this single value into per-channel weight.

  Squeeze turns (C x H x W) into (C x 1 x 1) using Global Average Pooling.
  
  Excitation turns (C x 1 x 1) into (C x H x W) channel weights using 2 FC layer with activation function
  inbetween, then which is expanded as same size as input.

  Rescale the output from excitation operation into feature maps as earlier.

  Based on the depth of the network, the role played by SE operation is differs. At early layers,
it excites shared low level representation irrespective of the classes. But in later stage, SE 
network responds differently based input class.
SE Block is simple and is added with existing CNN architecture to enhance the performance like 
ResNet or Inception V1 etc.

<summary>ðŸ”¥ MLP-Mixer</summary>
  <p>
    This particular network doesn't come under convolutional networks as the key idea is to use simple MLP architecture.

MLP-Mixer is a multi-layer perceptron based model, it uses common techniques like non-linearites, matrix multiplication,
normalization, skip connections etc. This paper is very interesting to the fact that when MLP was introduced, it was 
particular made upfront that the MLP architectures cannot capture translation invariance in an image. 

Let's see how things have changed. The Network uses a block of MLP Block with two linear layers and one activation function
GELU unit. Along with MLPBlock, there are two simple small block called as token mixer and channel mixer. Normalization is 
done throughout the network using Layer Normalization.

* First, the image is converted into patches
* These patches are also called as tokens.
* MLP is a Feedforward network.
* In Token Mixer, we mix these tokens using MLP, it learns spatial locations.
* In Channel Mixer, we mix the channels using MLP, it learns channel dependencies.
* The we combine of channel mixer and token mixer.
* It passed into Global Average Pooling and then 
into Fully connected layer.
