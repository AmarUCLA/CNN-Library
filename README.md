**ðŸ”¥ Basic ConvNet**

  - Simple Convolutional Network with BatchNorm.

**ðŸ”¥ AlexNet**

  ![AlexNet Block](Images/alexnet.png)

  - AlexNet is widely remembered as the **breakthrough CNN architecture** on ImageNet dataset, but surprisingly its not the first CNN.

**ðŸ”¥ VGGNet**

  ![VGGNet Block](Images/vggnet.png)

  - It brought in the idea of buliding **a block of network** like a template unlike previous CNN architecture where the network is built layer by layer with increasing complexity.

**ðŸ”¥ NIN**

  ![NIN Block](Images/nin.png)

  - **Network In Network** introduced one of the key concept in deep neural network of **dimension downsampling/upsampling using 1x1Conv layer.**

**ðŸ”¥ GoogLeNet**

  ![GoogLeNet Block](Images/googlenet.png)

  - It combined ideas from NIN and VGG network introducing InceptionV1 also known as GoogLeNet. 

**ðŸ”¥ BatchNorm + ConvNet**

  ![BatchNorm Block](Images/batchnorm.png)

  - BatchNorm was introduced as a concept to **normalize the mini-batches traversing through the layer** and had an impactful results having **regularization** effect. But why BatchNorm is effective is quite unclear? the author suggests that BatchNorm reduce internal variant shift but other researchers  pointed out that the effects which batchNorm is effective against is not related to covariant shift. It is still widely discussed topic in DL.

**ðŸ”¥ ResNet**

  ![ResNet Block](Images/resnet.png)

  - ResNet Architecture has huge influence in current DNN architectures. It introduces the idea of **skip connection**, a concept of **adding** an unfiltered input to the conv layers.

**ðŸ”¥ DenseNet**

  ![DenseNet Block](Images/Densenet.png)

  - Building upon ResNet, DenseNet introduced the idea of **concatenating** the previous layers output and as well the inputs to the next layers.

<summary>ðŸ”¥ Squeeze And Excitation Network</summary>
<p>
A typical convolution network has kernels running through image channels and combining
the feature maps generated per channel. For each channel, we'll have separate kernel which
learns the weights through backpropagation.
  
The idea is to understand the interdependencies between channels of the images by explicitly
modeling on it and hence to make the network sensitive to informative features which is further
exploited in the next set of transformation.

  * Squeeze(Global Information Embedding) operation converts feature maps into single value per channel.
  * Excitation(Adaptive Recalibration) operation converts this single value into per-channel weight.

  Squeeze turns (C x H x W) into (C x 1 x 1) using Global Average Pooling.
  
  Excitation turns (C x 1 x 1) into (C x H x W) channel weights using 2 FC layer with activation function
  inbetween, then which is expanded as same size as input.

  Rescale the output from excitation operation into feature maps as earlier.

  Based on the depth of the network, the role played by SE operation is differs. At early layers,
it excites shared low level representation irrespective of the classes. But in later stage, SE 
network responds differently based input class.
SE Block is simple and is added with existing CNN architecture to enhance the performance like 
ResNet or Inception V1 etc.
